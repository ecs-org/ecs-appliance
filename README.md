# ECS-Appliance

the ecs appliance is a selfservice production setup virtual machine builder and executor.
it can be stacked on top of the developer vm, but is independent of it.

See [the Administrator Manual](https://ecs-org.github.io/ecs-docs/admin-manual/index.html) for installing and configuring an ECS-Appliance.
